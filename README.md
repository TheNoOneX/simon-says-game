#Simon Says Game

A virtual implementation of the classic Simon Says game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of web development with a focus on DOM manipulation, event listeners, and interactive design.

🎮 Game Overview

The Simon Says game challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order. The sequence increases in length as the player progresses.

🛠️ Features

Interactive Gameplay: Follow the color sequence shown and try to beat your high score.
Dynamic DOM Manipulation: Visual effects are applied directly to HTML elements to enhance interactivity.
Responsive Design: Adapted for various screen sizes using CSS.
Event Handling: Real-time response to user clicks through JavaScript event listeners.

🚀 How It Works

The game generates a random sequence of colors.
The user clicks the corresponding buttons in the same order.
If the sequence is correct, the game continues with a longer sequence.
If incorrect, the game resets and displays the player’s score.


🧰 Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the game interface.

CSS: For styling and animations.

JavaScript: For game logic, event handling, and DOM updates.


📚 Core Concepts Covered
Document Object Model (DOM): Access and manipulate HTML elements programmatically.

Event Listeners: Handle user inputs like clicks.

CSS Animations: Enhance visual feedback with transitions.

Game Logic: Implementing a sequence-based gameplay loop.
